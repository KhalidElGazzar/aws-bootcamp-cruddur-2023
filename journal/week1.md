### During Live Session

During week-1 live sesion, I managed to follow-up and do all the steps (with a slight delay). I managed to get both Containers for the backend flask webapp and the frontend React app about 1.5 hour after the live session.

Below are screen shots for the first run of crudder home page and signup page directly after the session

### Code Commit best practice

Concercing code commit, I already have my own best practices and thats why I commited my own code before watching Andrew's first video after the session reminding everyone to commit code before the environmnet is destroyed.


### Notfications feature
I watched the notification video and managed to add integrate the notification feature into both the frontend and backend. No major issues were faced.
