### During Live Session

During week-1 live sesion, I managed to follow-up and do all the steps (with a slight delay). I managed to get both Containers for the backend flask webapp and the frontend React app about 1.5 hour after the live session.

Below are screen shots for the first run of crudder home page and signup page directly after the session

### Code Commit best practice

Concercing code commit, I already have my own best practices and thats why I commited my own code before watching Andrew's first video after the session reminding everyone to commit code before the environmnet is destroyed.


### Notfications feature
I watched the notification video and managed to add integrate the notification feature into both the frontend and backend. No major issues were faced.

Screen shots for notification feature:

### Containerizing Databases (DynamoDB, Postgress) and installing AWS-CLI  on Gitpod

I followed the video and all went well.

2. Installing aws-cli on gitpod ![Installing aws-cli on gitpod](week-01/installing-aws-cli-on-gitpod.png)

3. Ensure having both aws-cli and postgress in gitpod startup scripts ![aws-cli and postgress on gitpod startup](week-01/having-both-aws-cli-and-postgress-in-gitpod-startup-scripts.png)


4. Adding postgres to vscode extensions ![adding postgres to vscode extensions](week-01/adding-postgres-to-vscode-extensions.png)


After that I made two tests (one from the gitpos vscode terminal and the second from database explore) to ensure that postgress is working.

Screenshots are shown below:

1. Getting postgres to work as container from gitpod terminal ![postgre working as container from gitpod terminal](week-01/getting-postgres-to-work-as-container-from-gitpod-terminal.png)
